USBMCU is an MPLAB X project. It is only tested with the XC8 compiler.
It includes pieces of Microchip's MLA library, which is under their
own license.

All of the files begining with "usb" are part of the usb library and
should not be changed, EXCEPT for usb_config.h and usb_descriptors.h,
which are templates meant to be configured by the programmer.
